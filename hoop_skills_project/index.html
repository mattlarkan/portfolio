<p>Hoop Skills started in 2018 behind a passion to produce an elite basketball training center that caters to all levels of basketball. We believed we could use the same methodology to train players from age five to the professional level. We embrace technology. We research the science of how the human body reacts and functions. We believe the body’s capabilities far exceed our current imagination and we strive to find the limits. Training with Hoop Skills Basketball will bring new potential to your game and introduce your body to a new level of training. </p>

    <h3 class="subsection">Individual Training</h3>
    <p> One-on-one workouts are a detailed, deliberate approach to enhancing specific aspects of your game. They are designed with a focus on your individual needs and allow for additional education. Enhance your basketball IQ while working on skills such as scoring moves, post and perimeter play, shooting mechanics and defensive concepts. These sessions allow us to hone in on any mechanical discrepancies and make appropriate adjustments.</p>

     <h3 class="subsection">Group Training</h3>
    <p>Our training techniques can be applied to all age groups and skill levels — from the 5-year old fledgling basketball player to the highly advanced professional athlete. We have group training programs for the offseason and programs that compliment in-season activity. Group sessions are typically 60 minutes long and involve 1-2 coaches and 6-12 athletes.</p> 
    
     <h3 class="subsection">Performance Training</h3>
    <p> Hoop Skills Performance Division provides the most up-to-date training concepts and methodologies for improving basketball-specific athleticism for males & females of all ages and levels. A complete player is made up of athleticism, skill, mind and heart. Hoop Skills Performance Training is the systematic approach to improving basketball-specific readiness, strength, speed and conditioning.

A basketball player’s athleticism is the foundation of their entire game. An improvement in athleticism will decrease the occurrence and severity of injury and allow a player to raise the level of their shooting, ball handling, passing and defending. That is why the best players and teams are in the best shape and move efficiently on the court. Basketball players are not Olympic lifters, football players, or bodybuilders – so they shouldn’t train as such. Their training needs to meet the specific demands of the game. It takes more than just lifting weights and running sprints to improve true basketball athleticism.</p>
